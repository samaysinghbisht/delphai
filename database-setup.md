## Database Setup Proposal for Microservices:

To set up isolated Postgres databases for microservices in both test and production environments, consider the following key action items:

### Managed vs. On-Premise:

* For reliability and ease of management, consider using managed PostgreSQL databases in both environments. Cloud providers offer managed PostgreSQL services that handle backups, scaling, and maintenance.

### Single Server vs. Cluster:

* In both environments, opt for a PostgreSQL cluster for high availability and scalability. Use a primary and at least one replica for redundancy.

### Single Server/Cluster per Environment vs. Application:

* For isolation between test and production, it's best to have separate PostgreSQL clusters for each environment.
* Create separate databases within each cluster for individual microservices to ensure isolation.

### Managing and Provisioning Accounts:

* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage and provision accounts for applications and people.
* In the test environment, provide read-write access to developers and read-only access in the production environment.
* Automate account provisioning and de-provisioning using scripts or identity management tools.
